    "- character - `\"1\"` - character - `\"2\"` - character - `\"3\"` - stored in binary format - key takeaway - no matter what type using - to the computer it is all ones and zeros - python is keeping track of what the ones and zeros mean - in terms of if it is an integer - straightforward - bits from right to left - $2^{0}$ - $2^{1}$ - $2^{2}$ - $2^{3}$ - $2^{4}$ - $2^{5}$ - $2^{6}$ - $2^{7}$ - floating point numbers more complex - strings and characters - essentially stored as integers - each individual character in a string is stored as an integer - but those integers are then translated using a lookup table - ASCII table - the integer - `0` - means a certain character - integer - `65` - means - `A` - so strings are really just arrays of integers whereby before they are displayed on the screen are translated using a table full of squiggles - squiggle that looks like an - `A` - printed on the screen if the value of the integer in a string - `65` - all stored as ones and zeros - perfectly common to have a look at the integer version of a character - asking not to translate that character into whatever squiggle it looks like on the screen to show the actual number - so strings and integers translate into each other fairly seamlessly [1]"
